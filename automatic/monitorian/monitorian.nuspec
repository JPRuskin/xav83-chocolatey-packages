    <summary>A Windows desktop tool to adjust the brightness of multiple monitors with ease</summary>
    <description>
Monitorian is a desktop tool to adjust the brightness of multiple monitors with ease. The user can change the brightness of monitors, including external ones, either individually or in unison. For the system with an ambient light sensor, the adjusted brightness can be shown along with configured one. In addition, the user can change the adjustable range of brightness and contrast for each monitor seamlessly.
To control an external monitor, the monitor must be DDC/CI compatible and the function enabled. If a monitor is connected through an converter, docking station or other device, such a device must be also compatible. At least,  Surface Dock works. In contrast, an USB-A to HDMI/DisplayPort converter which supports DDC/CI is not yet known to exist. An USB-C connector or adaptor compatible with DisplayPort Alternate Mode does not fall under this category because it is virtually DisplayPort.

Add-on features are available on a subscription basis. Those features include the following:
 - Customizable hot keys and shortcut keys
 - Command-line options
 - Control over monitors more than 4

Add-on features will not affect the function to recognize monitors. It is advised to check if those functions work as intended during the trial period.
